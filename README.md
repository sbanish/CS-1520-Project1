# Shawn Banish - Project 1
This is my first project for CS 1520 - Pitt. My email is sjb111@pitt.edu.

# Project Plan
My goal of this project was to create a portfolio for myself to use for potential job prospects. I did every thing that I was planning on doing in my initial plan, and I am happy with the results that I came up with. 

# Comments
I have included some comments in my code explaining that I have some of the header's font sizes set to 0 because I couldn't decide if I liked including them or not. I just set the size to zero so therefore I can go back and change the size at a later date if I end up changing my mind.
